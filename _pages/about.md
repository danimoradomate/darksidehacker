Welcome to my site. I am a PhD student in Information Sciences and Technologies at UAM, my research interests include embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning algorithms. I am also enthusiastic about programing & electronics.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy playing video games, playing guitar, and simply sightseeing!
