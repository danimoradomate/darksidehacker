Welcome to my site. I am a PhD student in Information Sciences and Technologies at <a href='https://www.iztapalapa.uam.mx/'>UAM-I</a>, my research interests include traffic modeling in communication networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and autonomous robotic systems. I am also enthusiastic about programming and electronics, especially when it comes to building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.

Outside of work, I like to spend time with my family and friends, exercise, play video games, discovering new things, and travel.
